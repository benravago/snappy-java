# snappy-java

A java port of the [go-lang implementation](https://github.com/golang/snappy) of the [snappy compressor/decompressor](https://github.com/google/snappy).


For now, only the basic encode/decode methods are implemented.  Additional framing classes/methods and junit tests to follow, as time permits.
